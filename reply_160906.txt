Sept. 6

We modified Figure 1 by adding two panels which shows a x-y plane taken at z=0 and a x-z plane taken at y=0. 
We specified the regions as the referee suggested such as "+M hemisphere", "-M heimsphere", magentic equator, 
"right-hand hemisphere", and "left-hand hemisphere" and indicate them in Figure 1.
These terminologies will be used in the manuscript to explain the plasma phenomena.
We also add the convective electric field, the dipole moment of the magnetic anomaly, 
and the static magnetic field for the plasma flow in the figure.
We specified the origin of the coordinates in the figure so that the readers can easily understand the
regions shown in the other figures for the simulation data plots.


As kindly suggested by the referee, 
we added some publications in the section of "Introduction" as well as in the reference list.
